<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    Rx Maestro is a tool to cross-check possible drug interactions for patients with allergies or medications the patient
    is currently taking, if they are taking any. It is meant to be a one stop shop for pharmacists or patients to
    quickly see if any newly prescribed medication will interact with any of their currently prescribed medications. To
    achieve this goal, Rx Maestro taps into the publicly available Drug Interaction API maintained by the National
    Library of Medicine that houses information on over 1,000 different drug interactions.

    Rx Maestro will have records of patientsâ€™ medical history as well as medications they are on. The Drug Interaction
    API will be used to identify and store medications and drug to drug interactions between those medications within
    the MySQL database. The details of the patient's information, as well as the medications they are on, any allergies
    they have, and any interactions stored in the database will be displayed for users. This application could be
    helpful for healthcare providers to see any interactions the medication might have with the patient before
    prescribing the medication. It could also be used in the pharmacy by pharmacists while they double check
    prescriptions sent by healthcare providers. This tool could potentially reduce some of the drug-drug interactions
    that have the potential to cause severe consequences for patients.
